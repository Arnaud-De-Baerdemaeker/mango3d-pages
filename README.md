# Mango3D - 2 pages test

Reproduction on 2 pages of a website as a test.

The pages are build for mobile and desktop displays.<br />
The download page fetches data from an API and uses this data to dynamically set the latest versions (stable and beta) of the software.<br />
The same data allows to dynamically update the links to download the latest (stable and beta) version of the software.
